lfs_packages
============

Copyright (C) 2014 Steffen Sauler, GPL v. 3

Scrapes URLs, checks and downloads all packages and patches required 
to build  Linux From Scratch.

Simply execute it. If it should not work, check whether the following two
URLs exist:

'http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter03/packages.html'
'http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter03/patches.html'

If they changed, you could try to change the lfs and ptch variables
in the Python file respectively.
